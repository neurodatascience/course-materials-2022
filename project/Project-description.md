# Science on a wire

## Why "Science on a wire?

1. It is a reference to
   [World on a wire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_on_a_Wire), directed by
   Fassbinder, that I recommend
2. The idea of "simulating the scientific world" is a bit less ambitious than
   the simulation described in World on the wire, but could still provide us
   with some insights

## Motivation

This would help understand the consequences of effects such as

- File drawer
- P-hacking
- Low / high study power
- Pre-registration

## Project description

We are imagining a number of laboratories working on a similar scientific
question. For instance, we could consider the question of the involvement of the
cerebellum in Essential Tremor patients compared to normal controls. The project
consists in simulating the "scientific world", for instance N laboratories
acquiring data and doing analyses, basically each lab is sampling a cohort of ET
patient and NC, and test the hypothesis that cerebelum gray matter is larger /
smaller in ET compared to NC (this is just an example, the simulation would work
for any hypothesis). We would like to study the effect of the different
practices (eg those listed in the Motivation section) on the consensus results
in the literature. The consensus in the literature would be computed as the
result of a meta-analysis. We will simulate labs obtaining and publishing their
results, varying parameters such as :

- the effect size
- different sample size of ET / normal controls cohorts
- the p-value obtained as a function of degree of p-hacking
- how many labs are doing pre-registration
- the chance of a "non significant" results to be published in the literature
  (file drawer) ... etc.

## Output

With this "Science on a wire" environment, we will be able to see the effect of
pre-registration, file drawer, etc or on meta-analysis. Specifically, we can

- change the percentage of studies that are pre-registered (and therefore assume
  no p-hacking for these) and see how the consensus results change, assuming
  large or medium amount of p-hacking.
- see the effect of increasing average sample size in labs - keeping other
  parameters constant
- change the level of p-hacking that labs are doing
- etc !

## Implementation

The project should be collaboratif, written in python, using the Git/GitHub
tools to collaborate. The QLS slack workspace can be used to coordinate. I
suggest we start by creating a yml config file with all the parameters of the
"Science on a wire" simulator !
