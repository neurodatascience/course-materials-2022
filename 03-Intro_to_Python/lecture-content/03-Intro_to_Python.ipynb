    "\n",
    "### High-level\n",
    "* Strong abstraction from the details of the computer or the machine language.\n",
    "* Don't have to deal with 1/0's or allocating memory and registers.\n",
    "* Lots of nice built-in data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Interpreted Language\n",
    "* If you code in C/C++, you have to compile it, translating your human understandable code to machine understandable code which the CPU can execute.\n",
    "* Python code is translated into bytecode (low-level set of instructions that can be executed by an interpreter).\n",
    "* Executed on a virtual machine (VM) and not CPU.\n",
    "* Interpreter checks the validity of variable types and operations, as opposed to having to declare them, and having them checked on compilation.\n",
    "* Advantage: given the bytecode and the VM are the same version, the bytecode can be executed on any platform (cost/inconvenience is that it typically takes a bit more time to run).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object-oriented\n",
    "* Organized around objects. Everything in python (lists, dictionaries, classes, etc.) is an object (chunk of memory containing a value).\n",
    "* We won't delve into the object oriented philosophy today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic semantics\n",
    "* Variables are dynamic objects: think of them as labels on actual objects\n",
    "* Can set a variable to an integer, then to a string, etc...\n",
    "* Assign variables in a way that makes more sense to a human than it does to the computer."
