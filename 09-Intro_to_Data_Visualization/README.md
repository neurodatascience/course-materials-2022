# 9. Introduction to Data Visualization

## Welcome!

### Introduction

In this course, we'll be going over some fundamental concepts for the creation of visualizations from various types of data and data relationships, and the design of data visualizations.

The course will consist of a lecture portion, but most of our time will be hands on with examples and exercises using Python to create visualizations of a few select neuroscience datasets.

The expectation is not that you will be able to finish these exercises - some of them are indeed more complex than time will allow for in our brief time together - but that you become familiar with the various kinds of plots and several different graphing APIs that make them possible.

Working with data and creating visualizations can be a complex exercise with unclear answers that require implementation and design decisions acquired through practice. In sum, it's more important to stumble and learn how to learn these graphing libraries than it is to memorize them. In the world of data visualization things change daily!

### Installation instructions

Here is the list of required python packages you will need for this module (many of which you already have installed via your miniconda environment for the class):

```
bokeh
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
plotly
ptitprince
sklearn
seaborn
```

The following command should install the additional packages necessary:

```
conda install plotly ptitprince sklearn
```
